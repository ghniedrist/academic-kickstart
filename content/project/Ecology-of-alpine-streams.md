**Research in alpine environments**

Alpine regions are considered especially vulnerable to increasing climate change impacts and globalisation.
Steep gradients in the alpine environments allow to understand long-term adaptations of animals and ecosystems to the particular climate, but also to simulate prospective consequences of ongoing alterations.



**Niche Ecology of Chironomidae in Harsh Environments**

Non-biting midges (Diptera: Chironomidae) are the main inhabitants of alpine river-beds in terms of diversity and abundance.
Facing the phenomenon of high species diverstiy in these extreme habitats and of accelerated climate alterations in alpine regions, its provoked glacier retreat and the subsequent changes within benthic invertebrate communities living there, the understanding of species' realized niches and thus the knowledge of species preferences is of high interest for conservation biology and ecology. Furthermore, the gained autecological knowledge about preferences for environmental stressors related to glacier retreat allows the accurate indication of environmental change apparent from community shifts - and this I revealed within my masters thesis supervised by Leopold FÃ¼reder.
